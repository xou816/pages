{"data":{"project":{"name":"Emploi du temps Centrale Nantes","description":"<p>A timetable for the students of <a href=\"https://ec-nantes.fr\">Centrale Nantes</a>, designed to be fast and easy to use.</p>\n","more":"<h4>Background</h4>\n<p>Our school uses a software called Celcat to manage the students' timetables. While it seems rather reliable, it looks <em>really bad</em> and is barely usable on mobile. Fortunately, calendars are exposed as (styled) XML files, which makes it easy to parse them.</p>\n<p>This is exactly what this app does: an Express app fetches the XML, parses and caches the result. The React app does the rest.</p>\n<h4>Challenges</h4>\n<p>This is not a very complicated project, however it proved useful as a playground to test things such as server-side rendering and progressive web apps.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>calendar API + React app</li>\n<li>server caching</li>\n<li><strong>calendar customization</strong>: specific subjects (optional courses for instance) can be hidden</li>\n<li>offline access using local storage and <strong>server-side rendering</strong></li>\n<li><strong>mobile friendly</strong>: fully responsive, can be installed as a PWA</li>\n</ul>\n","tags":["edt-ecn","javascript","ssr","pwa"],"live":"https://edt-ecn.herokuapp.com","repository":{"owner":"xou816","name":"edt-ecn"}},"github":{"repository":{"ref":{"target":{"__typename":"GitHub_Commit","abbreviatedOid":"281ceff","url":"https://github.com/xou816/edt-ecn/commit/281ceff247a9f5872d8fb826fcfd73f7b9ba6cf6","committedDate":"2019-03-18T16:17:31Z","message":"fix issue when no subjects are specified","author":{"name":"Alexandre Trendel"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"name":"Emploi du temps Centrale Nantes","repoName":"edt-ecn","repoOwner":"xou816"}}
